Unique Features
==============
* change your context (e.x. 'cd @Work') and FOCUS
* `[ ]` whiny is opinionated about how it thinks you should work:
* whines about old next actions (it's not a next action if it's been around 
  for two weeks)
* `[ ]` whines if you don't have next actions that are tagged as goals (i.e. !weightloss) 
  and that you've finished a goal-tagged next action recently
  because whiny thinks that working towards your goals are important

  projects each week (it's not an active project if you're not working on it once a week)
